## Features

The extension uses an archetype-based plugin system that loads different features depending on which page you're on. 

Many of the original modifications (such as a 3 column layout in the Kinesis task creation environments, or duplicating tools to the end of the workflow) that only users of this extenstion were able to enjoy are now part of the main website!
